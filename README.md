## **Project Description**
The **On-Chain Attendance Tracker** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Flare Coston2 Network that allows users to mark their attendance on-chain. Each wallet can mark attendance **only once**, and the contract stores all attendees in an immutable list.

This ensures transparent, tamper-proof, and verifiable attendance logs—ideal for workshops, hackathons, events, online bootcamps, classrooms, and community programs.

## **Features**
### ✅ **On-Chain Attendance Recording**
Users can mark their attendance permanently on the blockchain.

### ✅ **One-Time Attendance Validation**
The contract automatically prevents duplicate attendance marks.

### ✅ **Global Attendee Count**
Anyone can view the total number of attendees recorded.

### ✅ **Wallet-Gated UI**
The frontend requires a connected wallet before interacting with the contract.

### ✅ **Transaction Feedback**
Users receive real-time transaction status:
- Pending  
- Confirming  
- Confirmed  
- Errors handled gracefully

### ✅ **Simple & Clean Integration**
Includes ready-to-use:
- Contract ABI  
- Wagmi + Viem hooks  
- React UI component example

## **How It Solves the Problem**
Traditional attendance systems rely on:
- Manual spreadsheets  
- Google Forms  
- Admin-controlled databases  

These methods are prone to mistakes, manipulation, or loss.

### This project solves those issues by offering:
### 🔐 **Trustless Verification**
Attendance exists on-chain—verifiable by anyone.

### 🔄 **Immutable Records**
No admin can delete or modify attendance logs.

### 🚀 **Effortless Automation**
Attendance is linked to wallet addresses:
- No emails  
- No personal data  
- No OTPs  
- No manual verification  

### 📌 **Use Cases**
- Blockchain bootcamps  
- Online events & webinars  
- University workshops  
- DAO participation tracking  
- Hackathons  
- Employee/volunteer check-ins  

By leveraging blockchain transparency and decentralization, this project provides a secure, reliable, and future-proof attendance management system.
